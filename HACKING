Making a release
================

1. Make sure configure.ac has the right version number, fix it in a pre-release
2. Run make distcheck, fix any issues and commit commit if not.
3. Update NEWS file (use "make release-news" target and then edit as you see fit)
4. Tag with: git tag -s 2.90.4
5. Build tarball with: make distclean; ./autogen.sh; make; make dist
6. Upload tarball: scp pygobject-2.21.5.tar.gz tomeuv@master.gnome.org:
7. Install tarball: ssh tomeuv@master.gnome.org 'install-module pygobject-2.21.5.tar.gz'
8. Send release announcements to gnome-announce-list@gnome.org; pygtk@daa.com.au; python-hackers-list@gnome.org; python-announce-list@python.org
9. blog about it 
10. Make post-release version bump

Branching
================

Each cycle after the feature freeze, we create a stable branch so development can continue in the master branch unaffected by the freezes.

1. Create the branch locally with: git checkout pygobject-3-2
2. Push new branch: git push origin pygobject-3-2
3. In master, update configure.ac to what will be the next version number (3.3.0)
4. Announce the branching, send email telling people to continue development in master and cherry-picking the changes that are appropriate for the stable branch
